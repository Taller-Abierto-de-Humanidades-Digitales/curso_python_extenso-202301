p1 = "‘Land for Those Who Work It’: A Visual Analysis of Agrarian Reform Posters in Velasco’s Peru\n\n ANNA CANT\n\n Abstract. Latin American military dictatorships of the twentieth century were often right-wing, elitist and violent. A marked exception was the left-wing Peruvian military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado. More exceptional still was the government’s use of visual media. Between  and  it produced approximately  posters, printed in editions of , to ,, to promote the radical Agrarian Reform Law. These posters provide vibrant representations of the agrarian reform’s ideological aspects, which have been under-studied. A detailed exploration of visual communication shows that the government deployed aesthetically sophisticated propaganda and symbols to encourage social participation in the reform.\n"

p2 = "On  October , General Juan Velasco Alvarado led a successful military coup to depose the democratically elected administration of Fernando Belaúnde Terry, under whom he had served as commander of the armed forces. By  Peru had already experienced seven successful military coups in the twentieth century." 

p3 = "The self-titled Gobierno Revolucionario de las Fuerzas Armadas (Revolutionary Government of the Armed Forces, GRFA) was funda- mentally different from previous military governments, however, as it was an institutional movement rather than one centred on a single general or charis- matic caudillo. Moreover, the GRFA came to power with a strong agenda of left-wing reforms.
