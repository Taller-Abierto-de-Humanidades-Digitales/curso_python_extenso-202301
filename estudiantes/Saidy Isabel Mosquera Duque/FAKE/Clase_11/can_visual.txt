‘Land for Those Who Work It’: A Visual Analysis of Agrarian Reform Posters in Velasco’s Peru

 Abstract. Latin American military dictatorships of the twentieth century were often right-wing, elitist and violent. A marked exception was the left-wing Peruvian military government of Juan Velasco Alvarado. More exceptional still was the government’s use of visual media. Between  and  it produced approximately  posters, printed in editions of , to ,, to promote the radical Agrarian Reform Law. These posters provide vibrant representations of the agrarian reform’s ideological aspects, which have been under-studied. A detailed exploration of visual communication shows that the government deployed aesthetically sophisticated propaganda and symbols to encourage social participation in the reform.

On  October , General Juan Velasco Alvarado led a successful military coup to depose the democratically elected administration of Fernando Belaúnde Terry, under whom he had served as commander of the armed forces. By  Peru had already experienced seven successful military coups in the twentieth century.
